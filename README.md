# Model 1
## Text To SQL Query Generator

## Introduction
The “Text to SQL Query Generator” project is an application of generative AI that aims to simplify database interactions by converting natural language inputs into SQL queries.

## Project Workflow
The project workflow begins with the user inputting a text-based query. This query is then processed by the Gemini tool, which generates a corresponding SQL query. The SQL query is then executed against the database, and the results are returned to the user.

# Model 2
## Invoice Extractor

## Introduction
The Invoice Extractor is a Generative AI model designed to extract and interpret information from invoices. This model can understand the content of an invoice and answer user queries related to it.

## Project Workflow
Data Extraction: The model begins by extracting data from the invoice. This could be done using techniques like Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert different types of invoices into machine-readable text.
Data Processing: Once the data is extracted, it is processed and organized. This involves identifying key information such as the invoice number, date, items, quantities, prices, total amount, etc.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): The model uses NLP techniques to understand the context and semantics of the extracted data. This allows the model to accurately answer user queries about the invoice.
